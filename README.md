When you run the code It will open a 300 by 300 px. I stored the board data in 3 list inside a big list called board. Then it draws the board by going through each square and if it is an * it just passes but if it is a X than it draws a x and same thing with O. Then to make the CPU it just picks a random empty square and places an O.

--- NOTE ---
I forgot to add a checker to my code, so it dosent know when to end or if it has won. Please reach out to me if you think you know how to code that.
